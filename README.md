# testing-app

This project is a Frontend / Backend Code Challange. The project is to implement a small client application for discovering trending repositories on GitHub.
A list of the most popular repositories of the last week should be displayed and the user should be able to star them. The starred repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a diferent tab. Some basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as: repo name, link to GitHub, description and number of stars. 
To keep things simple, the starring won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just stored in localStorage.

## Runing the application 

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and try it .


## API 

Can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/search](http://localhost:3000/api/search). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/search.js`.

The endpoint that provides 
 * A list of the most popular repositories, sorted by number of stars.
 * An option to be able to view the top 10, 50, 100 repositories should be available.
 * Given a date, the most popular repositories created from this date onwards should be returned.
 * A filter for the programming language.
